				<li>Q: How did you get this data?</li>
				<li>Q: Are the courses all up to date?</li>
				<li>Q: Why should I sign up? </li>
				<li>A: If you just want to browse through the courses and their evaluations, you don't need to sign up. If you want to keep track of the courses you're most interested in (and see how they lay out in the calendar), you need to sign up.</li>
				
				<li>Q: If this site says there are no course evaluations for a given course, does that mean that no course evaluations exist? </li>
				<li>A: Not necessarily. Although this site has detected and connected to <em>almost all</em> of the evaluations, it was not possible to connect to them all. If you find evaluations that fail to appear on this site <a href="mailto:jimmy.li@yale.edu">shoot me a line</a> with the evaluation's link.</li>
