			<p id="about_p"> It's now easier to make decisions about what classes to take. Here's what this site lets you do:
			</p>	
					<li>Search for classes more easily. You can filter by all the relevant criteria: course name, professor, number of units, exam/paper option, and time.</li>
					<li>Keep track of the courses you're planning to shop and the number of credits they add up to. Add the courses easily to your calendar and see how they fit into your schedule. </a></li>
					<li>Instantly get course evaluations for the classes you're interested in. Find evaluations from every past instance of the course with a click of a button. No more having to go to a totally different website and search through many different semesters of classes.</li>
